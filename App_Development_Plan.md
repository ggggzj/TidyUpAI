# TidyAI: 0 to 1 Roadmap and Product Strategy

## 1. Deep Dive into Pain Points
*   **Decision Paralysis:** Too many items lead to not knowing where to start.
*   **Spatial Blindness:** Getting used to mess makes it hard to see what is actually clutter.
*   **Lack of System:** Users know how to pile things but not how to establish a return-to-place logic.

## 2. Execution Steps from 0 to 1

### Phase 1: MVP (Minimum Viable Product) - Current Implementation
*   **Core Function:** Photo upload -> AI Visual Analysis -> Structured Task List generation.
*   **Technical Path:** Leverage AI vision capabilities to turn visual chaos into actionable JSON data.

### Phase 2: Spatial Mapping
*   **Function:** Allow users to scan empty rooms or cabinet interiors first to create a storage map.
*   **Idea:** When clutter is scanned later, the AI can suggest specifically where it belongs, such as: Put this sweater in Drawer B3.

### Phase 3: Commercial Integration
*   **Function:** Suggest specific storage solutions based on the identified mess (e.g., a rotating spice rack for kitchen clutter).
*   **Revenue Model:** Affiliate commissions from recommended products.

## 3. Market Competitors
*   **Sortly:** Focused on inventory management (what you have) rather than the act of tidying.
*   **Pinterest/Houzz:** Focused on aesthetic inspiration but cannot provide advice for your specific room.
*   **Clutter:** Focused on external physical storage services.
*   **TidyAI Uniqueness:** Action-oriented, functioning as a personal organization coach.

## 4. Product Design Highlights
1.  **Vibe Check:** AI provides witty or encouraging feedback on the room's current state.
2.  **Tidying Timer:** AI estimates the time required, encouraging users with messages like: This only takes 15 minutes.
3.  **Before/After Comparison:** Users take a photo after tidying, and the AI generates a comparison to provide a sense of achievement.
4.  **Expiration/Utility Check:** Identify expired items or long-unused clothing and suggest decluttering.
